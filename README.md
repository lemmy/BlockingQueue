Tutorial-style talk "Weeks of debugging can save you hours of TLA+".  The inspiration  for this tutorial and definitive background reading material (with spoilers) is ["An Example of Debugging Java with a Model Checker
"](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/programming-tlabuffer.html) by [Michel Charpentier](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/).  I believe it all goes back to [Challenge 14](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen) of the c2 wiki.

Each [git commit](https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue/commits/tutorial) introduces a new TLA+ concept.  Go back to the very first commit to follow along!  Please note - especially when you create PRs -that the git history will be rewritten frequently to stay linear.

This tutorial is work in progress. More chapters will be added in the future. In the meantime, feel free to open issues with questions, clarifications, and recommendations. You can also reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lemmster).  Basic TLA+ learning material can be found over at [Lamport's TLA+ page](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/learning.html).
