# BlockingQueue
Tutorial-style talk "Weeks of debugging can save you hours of TLA+".  The inspiration  for this tutorial and definitive background reading material (with spoilers) is ["An Example of Debugging Java with a Model Checker
"](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/programming-tlabuffer.html) by [Michel Charpentier](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/).  I believe it all goes back to [Challenge 14](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteen) of the c2 wiki.

Each [git commit](https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue/commits/tutorial) introduces a new TLA+ concept.  Go back to the very first commit to follow along!  Please note - especially when you create PRs -that the git history will be rewritten frequently to stay linear.

This tutorial is work in progress. More chapters will be added in the future. In the meantime, feel free to open issues with questions, clarifications, and recommendations. You can also reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lemmster).  Basic TLA+ learning material can be found over at [Lamport's TLA+ page](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/learning.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v06 (continue): Convert constants into variables.

In the section ["Limitations of Model-Checking"](http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/programming-tlabuffer.html), Michel Charpentier points out that ```BlockingQueue``` is deadlock-free under some configurations, but that model checking is not helpful with finding the underlying mathematical function.  This observation is true in general because we cannot ask TLC to compute the set of all configurations for which ```BlockingQueue``` is deadlock-free, but at least we can ask it to find as many data points as possible. From those data points, we can try to infer/learn the function.

In this step, we rewrite ```BlockingQueue``` to check multiple configurations instead of a single one (p1c2b1) at once. Note that the rewrite increases the complete state space to 57254 distinct states, but TLC continues to find the behavior shown in the previous step. This is because TLC - by default - explores the state space with [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). This [search mode](https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlatoolbox/doc/model/tlc-options-page.html#checking) guarantees to always find the shortest counterexample (if TLC runs ```-workers N``` with N > 1, it only returns the shortest counterexample with high probability).

We hope to [better support checking different constant values](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/272) in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### v05: Add Invariant to detect deadlocks.

Add Invariant to detect deadlocks (and TypeInv). TLC now finds the deadlock
for configuration p1c2b1 (see below) as well as the one matching the Java
app p4c3b3.

```tla
Error: Invariant Invariant is violated.
Error: The behavior up to this point is:
State 1: <Initial predicate>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {}

State 2: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {c1}

State 3: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {c1, c2}

State 4: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {c2}

State 5: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c2}

State 6: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1}

State 7: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c1}

State 8: <Next line 52, col 9 to line 55, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c1, c2}
```

Note that the Java app with p2c1b1 usually deadlocks only after it produced thousands of lines of log statements, which is considerably longer than the error trace above.  This makes it more difficult to understand the root cause of the deadlock.  For config p4c3b3, the C program has a high chance to deadlock after a few minutes and a couple million cycles of the consumer loop. 

Sidenote: Compare the complexity of the behavior described in [Challenge 14](http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgrammingChallengeFourteenTheBug) of the c2 extreme programming wiki for configuration p2c2b1 with the TLA+ behavior below.  The explanation in the wiki requires 15 steps, whereas - for p2c2b1 - TLC already finds a deadlock after 9 states (and two more after 11 states).

```tla
Invariant Invariant is violated.
The behavior up to this point is:
1: <Initial predicate>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {}
2: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {c2}
3: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {c1, c2}
4: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {c2}
5: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, c2}
6: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<p1>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, p2, c2}
7: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, p2}
8: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, p2, c1}
9: <Next line 53, col 9 to line 56, col 45 of module BlockingQueue>
/\ buffer = <<>>
/\ waitSet = {p1, p2, c1, c2}
```

### v04: Debug state graph for configuration p2c1b1.
    
In the previous step, we looked at the graphical representation of the state
graph.  With the help of TLCExt!PickSuccessor we build us a debugger
with which we study the state graph interactively.  We learn that with
configuration p2c1b1 there are two deadlock states:

![PickSuccessor](./screencasts/v04-PickSuccessor.gif)

The [CommunityModules](https://github.com/tlaplus/CommunityModules) release has to be added to TLC's command-line:

```
java -cp tla2tools.jar:CommunityModules.jar tlc2.TLC -deadlock BlockingQueue
```

Note that TLC's ```-continue``` flag would have also worked to find both
deadlock states.

### v03: State graph for configurations p1c2b1 and p2c1b1.
    
Slightly larger configuration with which we can visually spot the
deadlock: ![p1c2b1](./p1c2b1.svg).

BlockingQueueDebug.tla/.cfg shows how to interactively explore a
state graph for configuration p2c1b1 with TLC in combination with
GraphViz (xdot):

![Explore state graph](./screencasts/v03-StateGraph.gif)

```
java -jar tla2tools.jar -deadlock -dump dot,snapshot p2c1b1.dot BlockingQueueDebug
```

### v02: State graph for minimum configuration p1c1b1.
    
Initial TLA+ spec that models the existing (Java) code with all its
bugs and shortcomings.
    
The model uses the minimal parameters (1 producer, 1 consumer, and
a buffer of size one) possible.  When TLC generates the state graph with
```java -jar tla2tools.jar -deadlock -dump dot p1c1b1.dot BlockingQueue```,
we can visually verify that no deadlock is possible with this
configuration: ![p1c1b1](./p1c1b1.svg).

### v01: Java and C implementations with configuration p4c3b3.
    
Legacy Java code with all its bugs and shortcomings.  At this point
in the tutorial, we only know that the code can exhibit a deadlock,
but we don't know why.
    
What we will do is play a game with the universe (non-determinism).
Launch the Java app with ```java -cp impl/src/ org.kuppe.App``` in
the background and follow along with the tutorial.  If the Java app
deadlocks before you finish the tutorial, the universe wins.

(For the c-affine among us, ```impl/producer_consumer.c``` is a C implementation of the blocking buffer sans most of the logging).

### v00: IDE setup, nothing to see here.
    
Add IDE setup for VSCode online and gitpod.io.
